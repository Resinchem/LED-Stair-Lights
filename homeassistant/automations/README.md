# Automations

This folder contains two versions of the automations for the stair lights.  Due to changes in WLED, code changes were necessary for the automations.  **You will only need one of these files**.  If you are running Home Assistant core version 2021.12 or later, please use the stair_lights_ha_2021_12.yaml file.  If your version of Home Assistant is older than 2021.12, then use the stair_lights_old.yaml file.
